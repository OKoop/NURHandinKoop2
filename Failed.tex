\section{Failed}
I did not get within the asked accuracy for the derivative in 4(b).\\
While trying to collect all results and setting up the bash file the results for question $4d$ seemed to be wrong suddenly. Therefore I altered the normalization factor to have the movie show a bit more action (the factor needs to be $64^{3/2}$ instead of $64^2$. I also plotted the 3D-slices in one figure to spare some time.\\
I do not expect exercise 5f and 5g to have been done correctly, but thought it would be a shame to not try to implement them quickly.\\
I consider exercise 6 to be failed a bit, because the results are not astonishing. The logistic regression code used seemed to work fine with the Tutorial Exercise.\\
I did not make exercise 8.\\

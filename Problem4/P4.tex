\section{Zeldovich approximation}

Here we look at the answers to Problem 4 from the second Hand-in set. The general functions that I use are coded up in a more general file given before the solutions.\\


Our main functions file is given by:
\lstinputlisting{./Problem4/functions24.py}

We now continue to the answers to the subquestions:

\input{./Problem4/4ab}

\input{./Problem4/4c}

\input{./Problem4/4d}

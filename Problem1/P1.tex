\section{Normally distributed pseudo-random numbers}

Here we look at the answers to the subquestions from Problem 1 from the second Hand-in set. Note that I included the code I created for running 1b before it got deleted from the exercise. The general functions that I use for most of these exercises are coded up in a more general file given before the solutions:

Our script is given by:
\lstinputlisting{./Problem1/functions21.py}

It has to be stated that many of these algorithms are my own implementation of the C++-code included in 'Numerical Recipes'.\\
Now follow the answers to the subquestions:

\input{./Problem1/1a}

\input{./Problem1/1bthen}

\input{./Problem1/1bnow}

\input{./Problem1/1c}

\input{./Problem1/1d}

\input{./Problem1/1e}

\subsection*{1bnow}

We read in the seed saved from 1a to continue producing random numbers.\\
The theoretical distribution is the Normed Gaussian given by:
$$NG(x,\mu,\s)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\s^2}}e^{-\dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\s^2}}.$$
In this case, $\mu=3$ and $\s=2.4$.

Our script for this question is given by:
\lstinputlisting{./Problem1/Handin21bnow.py}

Our script produces the following output in .txt:
{\obeylines\obeyspaces
\texttt{
\input{./Problem1/outputs1bn.txt}
}}

It produces the following figures:
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The y-scale is logarithmic to be able to see the $-5\s$ and $5\s$ regions. I see that the outer regions do not have any values in the sample. This could be due to a few things: 1. A faulty RNG. 2. A mistake in binning. 3. The small size of the sample just not producing an 'outlier'.

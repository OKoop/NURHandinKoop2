\subsection*{1e}

We read in the sample from 1c. Now we perform a KS-test for each of ten given samples.\\
To spare time I did not plot the scipy-answer because it was already proven my own implementation gave the same result. Furthermore I increased the spacing of the plot, so less calculation have to be made.

Our script for this question is given by:
\lstinputlisting{./Problem1/Handin21e.py}

Our script produces the following output in .txt:
{\obeylines\obeyspaces
\texttt{
\input{./Problem1/outputs1e.txt}
}}

It produces the following figures:
\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{\textit{These are the scipy- and my own values of the KS-statistic (d). For 10 sets of random numbers, compared with a sample of normally distributed random numbers from my own RNG.}}
\end{figure}

For time efficiency I chose to plot it as subplots, but now it is not as clear anymore. 
Only the fourth set is consistent with my own RNG (BoxMuller method with $\mu=0$ and $\s=1$) according to the KS-test.

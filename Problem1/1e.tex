\subsection*{1e}

We read in the sample from 1c. Now we perform a KS-test for each of ten given samples.\\
To spare time I did not plot the scipy-answer because it was already proven my own implementation gave the same result.\\
I see now that running it on pczaal is faster than my laptop, so it is not needed.

Our script for this question is given by:
\lstinputlisting{./Problem1/Handin21e.py}

Our script produces the following output in .txt:
{\obeylines\obeyspaces
\texttt{
\input{./Problem1/outputs1e.txt}
}}

It produces the following figures:
\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{\textit{These are the scipy- and my own values of the KS-statistic (d). For 10 sets of random numbers, compared with a sample of normally distributed random numbers from my own RNG.}}
\end{figure}

For time efficiency I chose to plot it as subplots, but now it is not as clear anymore.\\ 
Still we can see that only the fourth set is consistent with my own RNG (BoxMuller method with $\mu=0$ and $\s=1$) according to the KS-test.

\section{Mass assignment schemes}

Here we look at the answers to Problem 5 from the second Hand-in set. The general functions that I use are coded up in a more general file given before the solutions.\\

I did implement a bit-reversal, but the way I implemented my FFT it seemed to not be needed in the end.

Our main functions file is given by:
\lstinputlisting{./Problem5/functions25.py}

We now continue to the answers to the subquestions:

\input{./Problem5/5ab}

\input{./Problem5/5c}

\input{./Problem5/5d}

\input{./Problem5/5e}

\input{./Problem5/5fg}
